VIDEO GAME LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

To execute just clone the git repository and compile or copy and paste code into a C++ file

The code should compile on Windows and Linux but Mac users may need to fix the clearConsole() function 

Since this is a simple program meant to demonstrate data structures, inputs are not verified and may crash the program
ie. if asked for a number inputing a letter may crash the program

If you ever get stuck on a screen try inputing a random integer and pressing enter to get to the next portion of the program,
since it runs in a loop the program may sometimes wait for user input before advancing so the user has enough time to read what 
is on the screen
